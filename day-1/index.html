    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating filed that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties</p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reaction and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved</p>

    <p>Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
